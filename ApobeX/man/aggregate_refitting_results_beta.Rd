\title{Aggregate Refitting Results (Beta)}
\usage{
aggregate_refitting_results_beta(data, column_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data to be aggregated, typically refitting results.}

\item{column_names}{A character vector specifying the column names for the result matrix.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing aggregated refitting results with row means for each set of 3 columns.
}
\description{
This function aggregates refitting results by calculating row means for each set of 3 columns.
}
\details{
This function takes input data, typically refitting results, and aggregates them by calculating
row means for each set of 3 columns. It checks if the number of columns is divisible by 3, creates an empty
matrix to store the aggregated results, and then loops through each set of 3 columns to calculate row means.
The function returns the matrix containing aggregated refitting results with row means for each set of 3 columns.
