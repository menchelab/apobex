\title{Rescale Mutational Matrix to Have the Same Total Number of Mutations}
\usage{
scale_matrix(mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{The original mutational matrix to be rescaled.}
}
\value{
A rescaled mutational matrix where each sample has the same total number of mutations.
}
\description{
This function rescales a mutational matrix to have the same total number of mutations across all samples.
}
\details{
This function takes an original mutational matrix as input. It calculates the total number of
mutations for each sample and rescales the mutation counts such that each sample has the same total number
of mutations. This is achieved by adjusting the mutation counts in each column proportionally. If a sample
already has the minimum total number of mutations, it remains unchanged.

# Example usage:
# Rescale a mutational matrix to have the same total number of mutations:
rescaled_matrix = scale_matrix(original_matrix)
}
