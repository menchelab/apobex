\title{Retrieve Sample Names Based on Metadata Conditions}
\usage{
retrieve_sample_names(
  input_data,
  genotype = NULL,
  culture_days = NULL,
  clone = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{A data frame containing metadata information, where each row represents a sample.}

\item{genotype}{A character vector specifying the genotype condition to filter.}

\item{culture_days}{An integer vector specifying the culture days condition to filter.}

\item{clone}{A character vector specifying the clone condition to filter.}
}
\value{
A character vector containing the sample names that meet the specified conditions.
}
\description{
This function retrieves a vector of sample names based on specified conditions to filter the metadata.
}
\details{
This function filters the input data frame based on the provided genotype, culture days,
and clone conditions. If no conditions are specified, all sample names are returned. If multiple
conditions are provided, the function applies them cumulatively (i.e., as an AND operation).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example usage:
# Retrieve sample names for samples with genotype "A", culture days 7, and clone "X":
sample_names = retrieve_sample_names(metadata_df, genotype = "A", culture_days = 7, clone = "X")
}
}
