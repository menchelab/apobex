\title{Eliminate Columns with Sum Less Than Threshold from Matrix}
\usage{
eliminate_low_mut_samples(matrix, threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{The original matrix from which to eliminate columns.}

\item{threshold}{The threshold value for the sum of column values.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{filtered_matrix}{The matrix with columns removed if their sum is less than the threshold.}
\item{filtered_columns}{A character vector containing the names of removed columns.}
}
\description{
This function eliminates columns from a matrix where the sum of values is less than a specified threshold.
}
\details{
This function takes a matrix and a threshold value as input. It checks the sum of values in each column
of the matrix and removes columns where the sum is less than the specified threshold. The function returns the modified
matrix with columns removed along with a character vector containing the names of the removed columns.

# Example usage:
# Eliminate columns with sum less than a threshold from a matrix:
result = eliminate_low_mut_samples(matrix_data, 1000)
filtered_matrix = result[[1]]
removed_columns = result[[2]]
}
